Use Case 1: Recommendation engines
If the use case was an ML problem....

1) What is being predicted?
- What's customers' interest.

2) What data is needed?
- The customer basic information(age, occupation)
- The customer's previous choose/interest
- Other similar customer's interest

Now imagine the ML problem is a question of software:

3) What is the API for the problem during prediction?
- Input: Customer's ID.
- Output: Customer's top 10 most likely intersts.

4) Who will use this service? How are they doing it today?
- Ecommerce platform.
- Provide the most likely interst items in the app's home page.

Lastly, cast it in the framework of a data problem. What are some key actions to collect, analyze, predict, and react to the data/predictions (different input features might require different actions)

5) What data are we analyzing?
- User's basic information and generate user tag
- User's search history
- Other users with same tag's decision

6) What data are we predicting?
- What items the user is interested.

7) What data are we reacting to?
- For every search and click data update in the database, we update the data, and perform ML.

Use Case 2: Airticraft scheduling
If the use case was an ML problem....

1) What is being predicted?
- The airticraft schedueling with highest density and lowest delay.

2) What data is needed?
- Past years airport schedule and the density/delay
- Weather or incidence for past year.
- Customer's feedback
- Aircraft company benefit.

Now imagine the ML problem is a question of software:

3) What is the API for the problem during prediction?
- Input : Date/Aircraft company
- Output : 	Recommenation scheduled for certain airport and the aircraft company

4) Who will use this service? How are they doing it today?
- Aircraft company
- They reference the history data choose how many tickets they will sell and how to arrange the aircraft.

Lastly, cast it in the framework of a data problem. What are some key actions to collect, analyze, predict, and react to the data/predictions (different input features might require different actions)

5) What data are we analyzing?
- Past years airport schedule and the density/delay
- Weather or incidence for past year.
- Customer's feedback
- Aircraft company benefit.

6) What data are we predicting?
- The max density and airplane number for a airport/aircraft company in certain date

7) What data are we reacting to?
- Weather change, incident situation's might affact the predict result, so we need to react.
